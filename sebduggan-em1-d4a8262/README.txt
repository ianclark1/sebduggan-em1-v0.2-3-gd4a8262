NOTE: I will no longer be developing or supporting EM/1. When I first started using FW/1,
I felt that this was something that was lacking. However, I now feel that this is something
which should be handled by the service layer, especially with the recent addition of the
view() method which allows generation of views into a variable. The ability of EM/1 to use
FW/1's view and layout conventions was one of its strengths, but is now unnecessary.

EM/1 adds email templating to the FW/1 framework. It is designed as an extension
to FW/1 - simply include the em1.cfc file in your Application.cfc.
